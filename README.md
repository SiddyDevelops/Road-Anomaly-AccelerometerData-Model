# Road_Damage_Detection__Accelerometer_Data
Severity of damage in roads is really important for taking right measures to fix it. A road can be deemed bad for several reasons
* Potholes
* Uneven coverage of old potholes with cement or road tar mixture
* Muddy and rocky settlement on the road

## Data Collection
Data was collected by us on our own. We used the app *sensor labs* which lets you access your mobileâ€™s sensors and then has the option to record and export the recorded data in csv.  We used the recorded data from *accelerometer*.

An accelerometer is an electromechanical device used to measure acceleration forces. The *piezoelectric effect* is the most common form of accelerometer and uses microscopic crystal structures that become stressed due to accelerative forces. These crystals create a voltage from the stress, and the accelerometer interprets the voltage to determine velocity and orientation.

Typical accelerometers are made up of multiple axes, two to determine most two-dimensional movement with the option of a third for 3D positioning. Most smartphones typically make use of three-axis models, and thus smartphone accelerometer is the smart choice as it will help you measure the sudden jerks and movement changes in one of these 3 axis.

We collected the data while riding a bike, we kept the bike speed constant at 30 m/s. We roamed in and around Electronic City,  Bangalore.  The dataset contains signal data from 14 different roads like ISBR road, Wipro village road, BSNL road etc.  To rank the roads, we used a scoring scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being the worst road and 10 being the best. Scores were assigned using the images we took for each road and the bike riding experience.

/Collecting your own data is fun, try it sometimes :)/
